## Tips / Hints 

- In Task 2, one of the prompts asks "What were the variable(s) that will be added?"  To clarify, you are looking for any variable(s) now existing in the `Corrected` data frame, that had not been available in the the `OrdwayBirds` data frame.

- In Task 3, you pick your own threshold. Whichever threshold you pick, make sure it satisfies the requirements of the task. 

- In Task 4, Use the ggplot template code provided to create the graph(s). 
Remark: You can also use `esquisser()` or `mplot()` to create plot that you think would be helpful, but this is not required.
